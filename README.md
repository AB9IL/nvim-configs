## Neovim configurations (Vimscript and Lua)


#### Neovim (Lua):
Neovim configured in Lua.  I have set this one up for writing code and taking notes.  With Treesitter and Telescope, it is able to do fuzzy searches in Vimwiki notes as well as work with strings buried deep in a file system.

#### init.vim (Vimscript):
Neovim with a few plugins to make it great for writing code, notes, and text.

#### init-noplugins.vim (Vimscript):
A spartan yet effective Neovim configuration with no plugins.
